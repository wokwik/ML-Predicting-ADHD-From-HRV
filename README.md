# ML-Predicting-ADHD-From-HRV

An ML project comparing the use of various ML algorithms for predicting ADHD using HRV dataset.

### Step 1: Feature Extraction
Feature Extraction from row HRV readings.

### Step 2: Data Cleaning
Data wrangling and Feature Selection.

### Step 2: Building ML training pipeline
Comparispon of the following Machine Learning algorithms:
- Logisitc Regression
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- XGBoost
- Light GBM
